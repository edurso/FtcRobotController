# TeamCode Module

Team code is written here.

OpModes are implemented in `opmodes` and their respective `teleop` or `autonomous` directory.

Robot Subsystems are implemented in `subsystems`

The Subsystems should be initilized in `Robot.java` and related constants should be in `RobotConfig.java`

Classes in `util` contain templates and utility functions.
